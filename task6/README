# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Gradient Boosting

This project trains a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** to predict house prices using housing-related features such as location, median income, and number of rooms.  
The goal is to predict the **Price** of a house based on the provided dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- `longitude` — Geographic coordinate
- `latitude` — Geographic coordinate
- `housing_median_age` — Median age of houses in the block
- `total_rooms` — Total number of rooms
- `total_bedrooms` — Total number of bedrooms
- `population` — Population of the block
- `households` — Number of households
- `median_income` — Median income of households
- `Price` — **Target variable** (house price)    #median_house_value
- `ocean_proximity` — Categorical feature (proximity to the ocean)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** — Data handling
- **Scikit-learn** — Machine learning & preprocessing
- **NumPy** — Numerical computations

## 📋 Steps Performed
1. **Load the dataset** using Pandas.
2. **One-hot encode** the `ocean_proximity` categorical column.
3. **Handle missing values** by replacing them with the column mean.
4. **Split the dataset** into training and testing sets (80/20).
5. **Train** a `GradientBoostingRegressor` model.
6. **Evaluate** the model using:
   - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
   - **R² Score** (coefficient of determination)

---

## 📊 Results
- **RMSE:** `48,375.08` → On average, predictions are off by around $48k.
- **R² Score:** `0.82` → The model explains ~82% of the variance in house prices.
